I started by following the workshop guide. It was going well until the command (control+C) in the terminal wouldn't work. I requested help and tried it once again. It worked. I was able to code and get the entire set up working. Vite, Express and Cors. Through the commands in the terminal. This build an app had taken longer to develop because I wanted to write out the code myself. It helped because I could inspect the page and use 'debugging' a way to improve my code. The coding part, some code needed changing, like 'beaches' had to placed into the object () instead of 'data' and the other data I had included. I wanted it slightly different but working the same way as the demo. Unfortunately the fetch request did not work because of the event listener. I plan to return and go over that so the the results render on the page. I was able to successfully load the repository onto Render with some help. I plan to return and fix the event listener so the results can load promptly onto the page.
